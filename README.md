An easy way to search images with Javascript

Add your own images and tags in imageMetadata at the top

I have included some CSS and HTML to show how it works

The searched tags are included in SessionStorage, so they stay after the page is refreshed and the tags are removed from the url bar
I am using awesomeplete for completing tags, and should be used alongside this for optimal performance
